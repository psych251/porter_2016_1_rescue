# Replication Project 

This project is a replication of Study 3 by Porter et al. (2016), Psychological Science. The project is part of the PSYCH251 class at Stanford University in autumn 2023.

In the **/data** folder, I have shared both the answers to the questionnaire as well as the demographic information provided by Prolific regarding the participants' detailed information. In order to match the two, I created a randomly generated new ID for each participant to replace the old prolific ID information. The annoymization process was conducted using the Annoynimization.ipynb script, not the previously provided annoynimization.py script. 

Data shared by the original article could be found in the **/original_paper** folder. The detailed analysis step is in the **/writeup** folder.
